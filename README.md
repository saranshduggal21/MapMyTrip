# MapMyTrip
This is an app made using the MERN stack that tracks a user’s trips (runs, hikes, drives, etc.) and later show’s trip statistics along with a map highlighting exactly where the user travelled. 

Backend:
- Utilized MongoDB to store user login and location data, and used Express.js and Mongoose to model an Express API that manages routes and queries to DB, that connects the backend and frontend.
- Implemented JWT authentication in order to identify users and protect user information in MongoDB.

Frontend:
- Will be resorting to React Native to create the frontend aspects (maps, screens, etc.).
